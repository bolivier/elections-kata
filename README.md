# Elections Kata

I converted this to JS from [a version in Java](https://github.com/SoftwareCraftsmanshipGrenoble/elections).

I wanted to practice refactoring and explore different ways of structuring the same code.

## Branches

I Created a branch called `functional` where I rewrote the code using Ramda, and
implmented the two new features. I'm not sure it's easier to read, but it
was definitely easier to implment the new features.

### Goal

You inherit this code base that is used to compute elections results in different ways.

You goal will be to avoid any potential fraud, and add the following features:

1. Count as null a vote of an elector in another district
1. Make sure nobody can vote twice.

How you can use this kata

We have found this kata useful to:

-   train on refactoring
-   play with TCR (we recommand using this awesome plugin for IntelliJ
-   discuss on tests
-   expriment on several designs
